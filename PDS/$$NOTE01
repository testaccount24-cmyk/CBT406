Notes about CQX.

The CQ program, called CQX by me, will cancel jobs in the print queue,
jobs that ALL HAVE THE SAME NAME.  Sometimes CQX will cancel active
jobs too, so you have to be careful.

CQX uses IBM subsystem calls to determine the status of jobs, and
also to cancel them.  By nullifying return code 28 from the SSOBRETN
call, you can use CQX to purge Started Tasks and TSU's which are on
the print queue, as well as being able to purge jobs.  See the code
for details how to do this.  The code is shipped with normal RC=28
processing in place.

Since CQX uses IBM system services, and they may change over system
releases, we have only as much control as we can have, manipulating
the IBM services.  (In other words, this isn't completely "our
program".)

I haven't tested CQX enough, either with RC=28 nullified or not, to
know if, and when, it will (for sure) cancel running jobs, as well as
jobs that are merely on the print queue (see next paragraph).

(Found out that it will cancel running JOB's either way, but not
running STC's or TSU's, the way it is currently coded.  STC's and
TSU's on print queue are cancelled if RC=28 is nullified, but
running STC's or TSU's are not cancelled.)

In macro IEFSSCS (now in SYS1.MODGEN, formerly in SYS1.MACLIB long
ago), IBM has added a new return code 32, for the SSOBRETN call.
I haven't tested that either, but I changed the program to
accommodate it, with a new message if it ever occurs.
